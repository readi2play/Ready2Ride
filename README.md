# Ready2Ride-
A Rework of my "DragonridingZoneDrakeButton" WeakAura as an addon with more Options

## DragonridingZone...What?

Months ago I implemented a kinda mighty WeakAura called **DragonridingZoneDrakeButton**, the naming followed the Blizzard Naming Conventions which lets it look a bit bulky.

I decided to give this project a rework because WeakAuras recommends not using the `SecureActionButtonTemplate` because it's obviously quite the oppsosite of what WeakAuras should do (e.g. change during battle, which is impossible with the `SecureActionButtonTemplate`).

## What is this for?

Similar to the WeakAura mentioned above, this addon is intended to provide an additional Button which allows the user to configure which dragonriding, ground- or flying mount is to be used in which zone of the Dragon Isles (and the old continents). Clicking the Button summons the configured mount for the zone the character is at.

Additionally it's intended to fall back to the [Chauffeured Chopper](https://www.wowhead.com/item=122703/chauffeured-chopper)/[Mechano-Hog](https://www.wowhead.com/item=120968/chauffeured-chopper) for new characters who haven't learned riding themselves.
